All other fields are simply for display purposes. Each Monitored Individual must have a unique value in the Identifier field. Typically the Identifier is the employeeâ€™s email address.

The Secondary Identifier field is used to list other email addresses that may be associated with this Monitored Individual. Email addresses in the Secondary Identifier field should be delimited with a semi-colon (;).

    end

```

### Prerequisites

You must have the following access configuration.

#### Access Prerequisites
You must have the following access in Enterprise Vault to configure this data source:

Read Access to:
- EV Directory DB 
- EV Vault Stores 
- All EV Archives 

Read Access to source archives:
- EV API Runtime (Same Version as installed EV Version) 
- You must have .Net 3.5 is installed to use the EV.API.


#### Enterprise Vault specific prerequisites

It is recommended to have retention policy to be set for at least 30 days or more for all users who are being monitored. You can find the Veritas Documentation for Managing Retention Categories [here](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/doc/122376360-127396844-0/v122376051-127396844). 

### Setup in Trace

The following sections provide the steps for installing the Relativity Collect On-Premises Application to collect the data locally, how to use a data transfer method for moving data to RelativityOne, and how to configure the data source in Relativity Trace.

#### Relativity Collect On-Premises Application for Data Collection

1. Navigate to the [Using Relativity Collect On-Premises]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) and install, configure, and schedule Relativity Collect On-Premises.

Some data source specific configuration is required while following the [Using Relativity Collect On-Premises]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) steps. That configuration can be found below.


1. Locate the **EnterpriseVault.json** file

1. Use the table below as a guide to update the values within that file.

      | Setting                           | Notes                                                        |
      | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
      | **Temp**                          | Folder path where temporary data might be placed             |
      | **Mailboxes**                     | Path to Trace Shipperâ€™s monitored_individuals.csv file. <br />Refer to TODO  to understand what timestamp will be used for the data for newly added monitored individuals |
      | **Server**                        | Specify the exact URL used when connecting to exchange server. |
      | **Username**                      | Specify login to admin account on exchange server            |
      | **Password**                      | Specify password to admin account on exchange server         |
      | **Logname**                       | A local file path where the log files for the application should be stored. Log path should always end with "verqu-{datetime}.log" |
      | **Destination**                   | The locally accessible path of the folder that needs to ship files from the Exchange server (note that the user running the service must have access) |
      | **DataRangeStart / DataRangeEnd** | This contains information on the start date of the first run |
      | **ConnectionString**              | This a standard SQL Server connection string that support all possible ways of connecting to SQL Server, including Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication |

1. Save the .json configuration files and navigate back to the [Using Relativity Collect On-Premises]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) documentation to complete the steps to configure Relativity Collect On-Premises.

### Data Transfer

[Shipper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/shipper.md %}) will be used to transfer on-premises data collected by the Relativity Collect On-Premises application to Relativity Trace in the cloud.

### Data Source

Use the "Setting Up Data Sources in Relativity" section of the [Shipper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/shipper.md %}) documentation to configure the Data Source.
